The debugger caught an exception in your WSGI application. You can now look at the traceback which led to the error. If you enable JavaScript you can also use additional features such as code execution (if the evalex feature is enabled), automatic pasting of the exceptions and much more.
Brought to you by DON'T PANIC, your friendly Werkzeug powered traceback interpreter.
